- better error handling
- explicit logger passed in with log levels (debug/application/request/transaction...)
- centralized errors, maybe with response codes?
- DTOs for requests and responses, maybe validation based on dtos with something like runtypes?
- add helm for security
- add jsdoc everywhere else
- unit tests?
